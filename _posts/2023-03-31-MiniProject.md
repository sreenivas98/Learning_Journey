It was very fun and exciting to learn C# programming language. It's already been six weeks into the learning journey and writing some sample programs doesn't give you the expertise to pursue your career as a developer. So as a group of three people learning C#, we decided to build simple stand-alone application to query a weather API and return the current weather conditions and display the results in a form. There are few concepts that I learned previously which helped me work on this project and also there are few concepts I had to learn to complete this project successfully.

<h2>What skills/knowledge that I had learned earlier in the semester were useful in this project?</h2>


<h2>What additional skills/knowledge I had to learn to complete your tasks?</h2>


<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>


<h2>Possible future enhancements</h2>

I have a goal to fully understand all of the ***object-oriented programming*** ideas throughout the course of the upcoming week. In order to grasp object-oriented programming, I still need to understand ***abstraction*** and ***interfaces***. I want to learn about ***files*** and ***exceptions*** in the upcoming week when I've mastered these topics. I want to fully understand every C# idea that will be useful to me in pursuing a career as a.net developer by the conclusion of this semester.
