In order to advance my career as a developer, I have chosen to master the C# programming language as a part of the software engineering class.

### Reasons
* Because C# is simple to learn and is comparable to C++, which I have previously learned in my undergraduate curriculum, I picked it as my language to study.
* I wanted to study the language used in the.NET framework since I had previously learned Java during my undergraduate degree and had utilized it in my profession. This would allow me to switch between careers as I want.
* I've found that all software companies either demand that you have professional expertise with Java or.NET. My understanding of Java is between 70 and 80 percent, thus I want to learn a new language that has the same applications as Java. C# is the best choice for this.

### Introduction on C# 
* Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft created C# as a component of the.NET framework in the year 2000.
* C# is a programming language that is very similar to C++, is simple to learn, and is currently used to develop many different applications, ranging from desktop applications to online sites that incorporate AI.
* C# programs and applications are created and executed using the.NET framework.
* Though it is not yet as popular as Java, the C# programming language is regarded as Java's main rival.
