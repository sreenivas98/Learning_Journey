While browsing the internet, I discovered <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/index.htm">tutorialspoint</a>, which are extremely useful for learning C# programming language, as well as <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/">w3resources</a>, which I can use to test my understanding of C#. On the W3Resources website, there are hundreds of programming problems arranged according to various topics, ranging from simple to complex, such as operators, datatypes, conditional statements, etc., to which you may add code to hone your C# programming abilities.
